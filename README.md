내년 를 대비하여 실습위주의 속성 커리큘럼을 제안합니다.
- 기간: 10월 초 ~ 1월초까지 진행 (단, 중간/기말 시험기간 2주씩 중단)
- 수학&딥한 이론보단 실습위주 진행
- 진행하는데 필요한 자료 제공

In preparation for next year's [Google Solution Challenge](https://www.gdscutd.tech/events/gsc), we propose a practice-oriented attribute curriculum.

- Period: From early October to early January (However, the midterm/final exam period will be suspended for 2 weeks)
- Practice-oriented rather than mathematics and deep theory
- Provide the materials you need to proceed

1. Python basic, Numpy, Matplotlib
2. Introduction (Introduction of artificial intelligence, history of development, NLP practical use example, CV practical use example)
3. ML Theory -> Pytorch Basic - MLP
4. CNN(AlexNet/VGGNet/GoogleNet/ResNet) - RNN(basic, seq2seq)
5. NLP - text classification (bag of worlds, CNN, embedding, Bert?)
6. OpenCV, YOLO -> (Also provides Raspberry training materials)
